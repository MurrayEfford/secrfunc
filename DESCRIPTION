Title: Helper Functions for Package 'secr'
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-11-23
Description: Certain functions for area and transect search and in secr use 
  numerical integration code from RcppNumerical and RcppEigen that is slow 
  to install. This package separates those functions, allowing them to be 
  used in secr without slowing down installation.
