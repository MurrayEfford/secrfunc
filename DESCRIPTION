Title: Helper Functions for Package 'secr'
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-11-26
Description: Functions are provided for internal use by the spatial 
  capture-recapture package 'secr' (from version 5.4.0). The idea is to speed up 
  the installation of 'secr', and possibly reduce its size. Initially the functions 
  are those for area and transect search that use numerical integration code from 
  'RcppNumerical' and 'RcppEigen'. The functions are not intended to be user-friendly 
  and require considerable preprocessing of data.
