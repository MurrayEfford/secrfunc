Title: Helper Functions for Package 'secr'
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-11-25
Description: This package provides some functions used internally by the spatial 
  capture-recapture package 'secr'. The idea is to speed up the installation of 
  'secr' itself, and possibly reduce its size. Initially the functions are those 
  for area and transect search that use numerical integration code from 
  RcppNumerical and RcppEigen.
